Notes on this file setup.

I haven't altered index.jade much, but I created a practice jade file, prac.jade. So far, I don't see the need for jade at all. It seems as though I'm writing a full HTML file and just including it into a jade file (see prac.jade). Afterwords, the only way to test this is to then convert the jade file into an html file, which is going to replicate the html file that is being included. Though that is currently working for prac.jade, it doesn't seem like this process is necessary.

I will eventually clean this stuff up (as in, I will be moving my stylesheets into the designated folder. I am only storing them here for ease of linking purposes for now).
